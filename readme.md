# Image Gallery Coding Challenge

This is a simple image gallery made using Javascript, Node.js, and CSS with SASS. It features 60 images paginated into groups of 10. Clicking on the thumbnail images allows you to view a larger version of the image in a modal.

The images were provided via the Unsplash API; in order to protect sensitive data, requests to this API are filtered through a separate server hosted on Google App Engine.
